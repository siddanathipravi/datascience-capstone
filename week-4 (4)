Data

To  solve the problems, we will need the following data:

1)	List of neighborhoods in Kuala Lumpur, This defines the scope of this project which is confines to the city of Kuala Lumpur , the capital city of the country of Malaysia in South East Asia.

2)	Latitudes and longitudes coordinates of those neighborhoods. This is required in order to plot the map and also to get the venue data

3)	Venue data, particularly data related to shopping malls. We will use this data to perform clustering on the neibourhoods.
Sources of data and methods to extract them:  

This Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Kuala_Lumpur) contains a list of neighbourhood in Kuala  Lumpur, with the  total  of  

70 neighbourhoods. We  will use web scraping techniques   to extract the data from wiki page, with the help of python requests and beautiful 

packages . They will get the geography coordinates of the neighbourhoods using python geography packages which will give us the latitude and 

longitude coordinate of the neighbourhoods.

After that, we will use Foursquare API to get the venue data for those neighbourhoods. Foursquare has one of the largest database of 105+million 

places and is used by over 125,000developers. Foursquare API will provide many categories of the venue data, we are participating interested in the 

shopping mall category in order to help us to solve the business problem put forward .This is a project  that will make use of many data science  

skill , from web scraping(Wikipedia) , working with API (Foursquare), data wrangling, to machine learning (K-means clustering ) and map 

visualization(Folium). In the next section , we will present the methodology section where we will discuss the steps taken in this project, the 

data and the machine learning techniques that was used.
